### Correlation & Regression for the data

**Correlation** is the degree of relationship between two continuous random variable.

The value of correlation is denoted as **"r"**. it always lies between -1 to +1 ie. **( -1\<= r \<= +1)** the code for calculating correlation in r programming is **cor(data)**

the data should be in **data-Frame formate or cbind formate**

**Regression** is the mathematical relationship between one dependent variable to one or more independent variable. linear Regression can be classified into two types:

1.  Simple Linear Regression (one dependent variable and one independent variable)
2.  Multiple Linear Regression (one dependent Variable and two or more independent Variable)

The code creating Linear Regression Equation in R-programming is **"lm()"**
