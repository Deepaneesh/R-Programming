### **R Programming**

#### **Day_of_the_date**

-   In this folder , I created the code for finding the day of the date by using R programming

-   In R programming there is a function to find the day of the date . It is already in the package **Lubridate**

-   I used the **readline and scan** function to get input form external source

#### **Correlation & Regression**

**Correlation** measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It is quantified by the correlation coefficient, typically denoted as Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), which ranges from -1 to 1. A value close to 1 indicates a strong positive relationship, while a value close to -1 indicates a strong negative relationship, and a value around 0 suggests no linear relationship.

**Regression** is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal is to estimate the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables. In simple linear regression, a straight line is fitted to the data to predict the dependent variable. The regression equation helps understand how changes in the independent variables affect the dependent variable.

#### **Histogram & Line Plot**

A **histogram** is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It divides the data into intervals (bins) and displays the frequency or count of data points within each bin. The height of each bar indicates the number of data points in that interval, helping to visualize the shape, spread, and central tendency of the data.

A **line plot** (or line graph) displays data points along a continuous line, typically used to show trends over time. Each point represents a value from the dataset, and the points are connected by lines to highlight the progression or pattern of the data. Line plots are particularly useful for showing changes in a variable over intervals, such as time or ordered categories.

#### **Measure of Central Tendency for Discrete Data**

The **measure of central tendency** for discrete data refers to statistical measures that describe the center or typical value of a dataset. The main measures are the **mean**, **median**, and **mode**. The **mean** is the arithmetic average, calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values. The **median** is the middle value when the data is arranged in order, representing the point that divides the data into two equal halves. The **mode** is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. These measures help summarize the data, offering insights into the central position of the values.

#### **Measure of Central Tendency for Continuous Data**

The **measure of central tendency** for continuous data refers to values that represent the center of a distribution. For continuous data, the most common measures are the **mean**, **median**, and **mode**. The **mean** is the average of all data points, calculated by summing the values and dividing by the number of observations. The **median** is the value that separates the dataset into two equal halves when sorted in ascending or descending order. The **mode** is the value that appears most frequently, though it may not always exist in continuous data. These measures help describe the central location of continuous data.

#### **Measure of Dispersion**

**Measure of dispersion** refers to the extent to which data points in a dataset spread out from the central value. The key measures of dispersion are **range**, **variance**, and **standard deviation**. The **range** is the difference between the maximum and minimum values, giving a simple measure of spread. **Variance** quantifies how much individual data points differ from the mean, while the **standard deviation** is the square root of the variance, providing a more interpretable measure of spread in the same units as the data. These measures help understand the variability or consistency within a dataset.

#### **Ogive Curve**

An **ogive curve** is a graphical representation of cumulative frequency distribution. It shows how the cumulative frequency of a dataset increases as you move along the range of values. The curve is plotted by marking cumulative frequencies at the upper class boundaries of each class interval and connecting the points with a smooth line. An ogive helps in understanding the distribution, identifying percentiles, and determining median, quartiles, and other summary statistics. It is commonly used to visualize the cumulative nature of data and analyze the spread of values.
